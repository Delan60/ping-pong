- Added a layout
  - To consider -> resizing the screen with below defined height
- Added paddle, introduced movement
  - To consider -> moving paddle with a mouse instead
  - Optionally, paddles could be added to ball physics to avoid an additional call to requestAnimationFrame
- Added second paddle
  - to consider, introducing a new keymap vs player vs AI
- Added traces
  - Ideally, traces could be added to ball physics to avoid an additional call to requestAnimationFrame
- Added leaderboard
  - need to add a logic to begin start match
  - leaderboard can potentially be a separate screen
  - we could add a player's name to leaderboard if they have a high score
